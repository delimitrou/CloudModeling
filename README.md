# **_CloudModel_**

**_CloudModel_** monitors the unreported/fluctuating resource allocations in the IaaS Cloud services. Currently, we have the designed and implemented **_CacheInspector_**, which can determine the performance and number of levels of CPU cache resources from inside a cloud instance. More interesting, **_CacheInspector_** can determine the capacity of cache allocation in hundreds of milliseconds, enabling it to work with self-adjusting applications.
